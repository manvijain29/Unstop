Problem Description:
1. There are 80 seats in a coach of a train with only 7 seats in a row and last row of only 3 seats. For
simplicity, there is only one coach in this train.
2. One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
3. If person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
4. If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby
seats are booked.
5. User can book as many tickets as s/he wants until the coach is full. 6. You don’t have to create login
functionality for this application.
How it should function?
1. Input required will only be the required number of seats. Example: 2 or 4 or 6 or 1 etc.
2. Output should be seats numbers that have been booked for the user along with the display of all the
seats and their availability status through color or number or anything else that you may feel fit.
What all you need to submit?
1. You need to write code (functions) as per the conditions and functionality mentioned above.
2. You need to submit the database structure you’ll be creating as per your code.
3. You need to host it on any of the free/paid platform so that you can provide as a working web URL for
this problem.
4. You need to send us the code a zip file for us to look at your code and evaluate the same. You can also
send us GIT link for the same.
There are some seats already booked in that coach. So your code should be able to find the seats
available and then book them.
